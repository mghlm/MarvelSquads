iOS Engineer Task
=================

Here at Plum, we work in "[squads](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/)" – a more startup-appropriate name for saying small, cross-functional teams that are focussed on a mission and KPI.

The fundamental basis of any squad, is a team of kick-ass superheroes. Hence this task,
**The Superhero Squad Maker.** You mission is to build the ultimate superhero squad using
the [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com) for data.

The app is simple. When opened, it shows your current squad (if any) and a list of all
characters from the Marvel API. Tapping on a character shows details and gives you the
option to recruit or fire the character. We've included a design spec describing the user
experience and interactions.

You're expected to use some sort of in-app data ersistence mechamisn so the squad persists
between app restarts.

To use the Marvel API you need to sign up for a developer account. Once you sign up you
will find your API keys in the Account section. If you don't want to sign up, we can
provide you with our own API key.

**Note**
For your app to work with the API, it's important to add "*" as an Authorized Referrer
in the Account section.

Deliverable
-----------

You should write your solution in Swift 5 and deliver it as a Pull Request in your repo.
Document your design choices and anything else you think we need to know in the PR description.

What we look for
----------------

In a nutshell, we're looking for a functioning app and correct, tidy, production-quality
code. Imagine that your code will be read by other developers in your team – keep them happy :-)

We don't want you to reinvent the wheel so feel free to use whatever libraries you deem
appropriate, but please explain your decisions in the PR.
